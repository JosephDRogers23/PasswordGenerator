EXPLANATION

This project should first be run with the command line argument "g" - i.e. "java pw_check -g". This will generate a list of all valid passwords 
according to a set of specifications. These specifications are:

-Must be 5 characters long
-Must contain 1-3 capital letters, 1-2 numbers, and 1-2 symbols (!,@,$,%,&,* only)
-Must not contain any words from dictionary.txt or those words with numbers replacements (1 for i or l, 4 for a, 7 for t, 0 for o, 3 for e, or 5 for s)

This will be a very large text file, roughly 180 MB. Afterward, when run without any command line arguments, it prompt the user to enter a possible password
and will indicate if it is valid; if it is not, it will provide 15 possible passwords with the longest prefix to the entered password.

I am including this project in my GitHub reportoire because I put in a large amount of work to make sure that this project was fully functional,
and I am proud of the end result. I received a 100% on this submission.
